# PictoPhone (working name)

An app being built in [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) for display on a touch screen attached to a Raspberry Pi.

As a starting point we have used [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

## Install

*(Instructions more or less taken completely from the electron-react-boilerplate README!)*

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saksdirect/PictoPhone.git PictoPhone
```

And then install dependencies.

```bash
$ cd PictoPhone && npm install
```


## Run

Run this two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```bash
$ npm run hot-server
$ npm run start-hot
```

or run two servers with one command

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

*Note: requires a node version >= 4 and an npm version >= 2.*
